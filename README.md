# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This repository is a collection of my implementation of various data structures and algorithms in Java. The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive resource for learning data structures and algorithms.

The repository will cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Hash Tables
- Trees (including BSTs, AVL Trees, and Heaps)
- Graphs
- Sorting Algorithms (including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Radix Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (including Linear Search and Binary Search)
- Dynamic Programming

The repository will also include examples of how to use these data structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems. I will also make sure to include unit tests for each implementation to ensure that the code is working correctly.

The goal of this repository is to provide a single resource for learning data structures and algorithms, making it easier for people to learn and understand these concepts.
