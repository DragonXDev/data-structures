# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java. Its a resource for learning and understanding fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms, + complete code for the ***DSA(H) class @ VCS***.

## Topics Covered

The repository includes implementations of:

- Arrays and Linked Lists  
- Stacks and Queues  
- HashMaps and HashSets  
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs, Heaps)  
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, etc.)  
- Sorting Algorithms  
- Dynamic Programming

## How to Use

To get started, clone the repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dragonxdev/data-structures.git
```

Then, navigate to the repository:

```bash
cd data-structures
```

Each topic has its own directory with Java files. You can compile and run any file using:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute! ðŸš€
